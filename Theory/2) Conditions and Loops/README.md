Decision Making


Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
The if statement is one of the most frequently used conditional statements.
If the if statement's condition expression evaluates to true, the block of code inside the if statement is executed. If the expression is found to be false, the first set of code after the end of the if statement (after the closing curly brace) is executed.
Syntax:
```
if (condition) {
   //Executes when the condition is true
}
```
Any of the following comparison operators may be used to form the condition:
< less than
> greater than
!= not equal to
== equal to
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to

For example:
Remember that you need to use two equal signs (==) to test for equality, since a single equal sign is the assignment operator.


if...else Statements


An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the condition evaluates to false.
For example:
As age equals 30, the condition in the if statement evaluates to false and the else statement is executed.

Nested if Statements


You can use one if-else statement inside another if or else statement.
For example:
You can nest as many if-else statements as you want.

else if Statements


Instead of using nested if-else statements, you can use the else if statement to check multiple conditions.
For example:
The code will check the condition to evaluate to true and execute the statements inside that block.
You can include as many else if statements as you need.

Logical Operators


Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.

Let's say you wanted your program to output "Welcome!" only when the variable age is greater than 18 and the variable money is greater than 500.
One way to accomplish this is to use nested if statements:
However, using the AND logical operator (&&) is a better way:
If both operands of the AND operator are true, then the condition becomes true.


The OR Operator


The OR operator (||) checks if any one of the conditions is true.
The condition becomes true, if any one of the operands evaluates to true.
For example:
The code above will print "Welcome!" if age is greater than 18 or if money is greater than 500.

The NOT !) logical operator is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, the NOT logical operator will make it false.
Example:
!(age > 18) reads as "if age is NOT greater than 18".


The switch Statement


A switch statement tests a variable for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.
Syntax:
```
switch (expression) {
   case value1 :
     //Statements
     break; //optional
   case value2 :
     //Statements
     break; //optional
    //You can have any number of case statements.
    default : //Optional
       //Statements
}
```
- When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute until a break statement is reached.
- When a break statement is reached, the switch terminates, and the flow of control jumps to the next line after the switch statement.
- Not every case needs to contain a break. If no break appears, the flow of control will fall through to subsequent cases until a break is reached.

The example below tests day against a set of values and prints a corresponding message.
You can have any number of case statements within a switch. Each case is followed by the comparison value and a colon.


The default Statement


A switch statement can have an optional default case.
The default case can be used for performing a task when none of the cases is matched.

For example:
No break is needed in the default case, as it is always the last statement in the switch.

The switch Expression


The switch expression allows multiple comma-separated values per case and returns a value for the whole switch-case block.

For example:
The switch expression makes the switch-case block much shorter and doesn't use a break statement.
Notice the -> shorthand after the cases.

while Loops


A loop statement allows to repeatedly execute a statement or group of statements.

A while loop statement repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

Example:
The while loops check for the condition x > 0. If it evaluates to true, it executes the statements within its body. Then it checks for the statement again and repeats.
Notice the statement x--. This decrements x each time the loop runs, and makes the loop stop when x reaches 0.
Without the statement, the loop would run forever.


while Loops


When the expression is tested and the result is false, the loop body is skipped and the first statement after the while loop is executed.
Example:
Notice that the last print method is out of the while scope.

for Loops


Another loop structure is the for loop. A for loop allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute a specific number of times.
Syntax:
```
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
   statement(s)
}
```
Initialization: Expression executes only once during the beginning of loop
Condition: Is evaluated each time the loop iterates. The loop executes the statement repeatedly, until this condition returns false.
Increment/Decrement: Executes after each iteration of the loop.

The following example prints the numbers 1 through 5.
This initializes x to the value 1, and repeatedly prints the value of x, until the condition x<=5 becomes false. On each iteration, the statement x++ is executed, incrementing x by one.
Notice the semicolon (;) after initialization and condition in the syntax.

for Loops


You can have any type of condition and any type of increment statements in the for loop.
The example below prints only the even values between 0 and 10:
A for loop is best when the starting and ending numbers are known.

do...while Loops


A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except that a do...while loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time.
Example:
Notice that the condition appears at the end of the loop, so the statements in the loop execute once before it is tested.
Even with a false condition, the code will run once.
Example:
Notice that in doâ€¦while loops, the while is just the condition and doesn't have a body itself.



Loop Control Statements


The break and continue statements change the loop's execution flow.
The break statement terminates the loop and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.
Example:
The continue statement causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and then immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating. In other words, it makes the loop skip to its next iteration.
Example:
As you can see, the above code skips the value of 30, as directed by the continue statement.
